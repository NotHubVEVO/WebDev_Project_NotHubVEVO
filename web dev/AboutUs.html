                <stron>My Story:</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
                I started my snowbording jerny at a young age.<br>
                It began as a way to connect with my friends and family.<br>
                Me and my frinds racing to see who gets to the bottum of the slope first.<br>
                Soon enough I was entering compettitions and now its my career.<br>
                This is a dream that came true for me as all I wished to do when I got older was to snowboard.<br>
                When I'm on the mountains it's quiet, I feel free and everything else fades away.<br>
                I wish everyone in the world could experiance this fealing of freedom, so this is why I wanted to have a website.<br>
                I hope you get the change to book a holiday and meet our skiing and snowboarding team to help you learn and get better.<br>
